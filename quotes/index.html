      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"Ogres are like onions." - Shrek</h2>
        <p>
          I obviously have to start with probably the most quoted Shrek quote of
          all time, "Ogres are like onions." This was said by Shrek to Donkey
          when they were walking through the corn field. Shrek was trying to
          explain how ogres are more than just they appear, they are complex
          creatures with LAYERS!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"What are you doing in my SWAMP?" - Shrek</h2>
        <p>
          This is another very classic Shrek quote. Shrek yells this at all of
          the fairy tale creatures who have been dumped in HIS SWAMP by Lord
          Farquaad. I think this is just a fun line to say if you try to imitate
          Shrek.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"Do you know the muffin man?" - Gingy</h2>
        <p>
          I know I already covered this in Gingy sections of the character page,
          but I feel that this is just such a great scene it deserves to be
          mentioned again. This is an incredibly funny back and forth between
          Gingy and Lord Farquaad where they are talking about knowing the
          Muffin Man.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"Better out than in, I always say!" - Shrek</h2>
        <p>
          This is just another classic and funny quote. But throughout the
          movie, it plays a much bigger role than just being funny. It shows
          that Fiona and Shrek are actually more alike than they think. This is
          used as a great way to progress their relationship. Not only does this
          play a role in Shrek and Fiona's relationship, it's also a part of the
          second movie. When Fiona and Shrek are having dinner with Harold and
          Lillian, Shrek says this line when Fiona burps. This really shows how
          different Shrek and Fiona are from Fiona's parents, and it reinforces
          Harold's initial beliefs and disliking of Shrek.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"Well that's not very nice. It's just a donkey." - Shrek</h2>
        <p>
          This is from when Farquaad says "What's that? It's hideous!" This was
          an attack at Shrek, but by saying this Shrek made it about Donkey.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"And in the morning, I'm making waffles!" - Donkey</h2>
        <p>
          This is probably my favorite Donkey quotes. Donkey says this to Shrek
          when they first get to Shrek's swamp. This line is just so fun and I
          think it shows how fun Donkey is. This line is also refrenced in the
          forth movie when Donkey goes to try and eat some waffles that are
          actually a trap set by the rogue ogres.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"If that was me, you'd be dead." - Shrek</h2>
        <p>
          This is the scene where Donkey thinks Shrek made a stinky fart. But in
          reality, it was the sulfer from the volcano. Shrek says this because
          if it was him making the smell, Donkey would pass out because of how
          bad the stench is.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"Do you think he's compensating for somthing?" - Shrek</h2>
        <p>
          Shrek says this when they first see Lord Farquaad's castle to Donkey.
          This is an example of when Shrek uses some adult humor to be such a
          great and enjoyable movie for everyone of all ages.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>
          "You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear." -
          Shrek
        </h2>
        <p>
          This is said to Donkey when Shrek and Donkey are laying on the ground
          under the star at night. Shrek is telling Donkey about the
          constallations and how they can tell stories. Donkey thinks Shrek is
          making this all up and then shrek says this quote. This is a very
          important lesson, especsially to Shrek, because ogres are often very
          misunderstood and they are much more than they appear.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"I'm an ogre, ROAR!" - Donkey</h2>
        <p>
          This is when Shrek and Fiona are having a fight about weather to stay
          in Far Far Away. Shrek says "I'm an ogre" and then roars at a little
          dog. Donkey immitates Shrek for this because Shrek was kidna being a
          jerk by doing that and he deserved to be made of.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>
          "Cute, button nose? Thick, wavy locks? Taut, round buttocks?" - Shrek
        </h2>
        <p>
          I think this is a great quote because it shows how attractive Shrek is
          in human form. This is when Shrek wakes up to a bunch of girls all
          around him after he fell asleep from drinking that potion. When he
          woke up he realized that he was turned into a human and he thought
          that would make Fiona really like him and have a happily ever after.
          Donkey was turned into a noble steed and it's believed that Dragon was
          turned into a pegasus.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>
          "Donkey, you have the right to remain silent... what you lack is the
          capacity." - Shrek
        </h2>
        <p>
          This is from when Shrek and Donkey were getting arrested because they
          were accused for stealing by Fairy Godmother when they overheard that
          Prince Charming is her son. Donkey kept saying that no one told him he
          as the right to remain silent, so Shrek made this joke.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>
          "Somday, I will repay you. Unless, of course, I can't find you or if I
          forget" - Shrek
        </h2>
        <p>
          Shrek said this during the scene where he's a human and he robs a
          random cart so that he can fit in. I'm including this because it's
          just really, really funny and brings a lot of joy to the movie
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"Fear me, if you dare!" - Puss in Boots</h2>
        <p>
          This is Puss' line that he is know for saying. He also makes the
          triangular p with his sword in a tree or something. This is a great
          quote from Puss because it shows how brave he is. While Puss may be a
          rather small cat, he is still very brave and fearless, some might even
          say he is our favorite fearless hero.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"No! That is just a rumor, spread by dogs!" - Puss in Boots</h2>
        <p>
          This is from the first Puss in Boots film when Jill said "Is it true a
          cat always lands on its feet?" I think this is a really funny response
          (that's it).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"I know you won't. So I won't make you choose." - Humpy Dumpty</h2>
        <p>
          This is a really nice quote from one of the ending scenes of Puss in
          Boots. Humpty Dumpty is trying to get Puss to save the town of San
          Ricardo instead of trying to save him and the town because he can't do
          both. Puss doesn't want to let go of Humpty because he is his brother.
          This is just a really sweet scene.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>
          "I'm Death. And I don't mean it metaphorically or rhetorically or
          poetically or theoretically or any other fancy way. I'M DEATH.
          STRAIGHT UP!" - Death
        </h2>
        <p>
          This is such a cool quote from Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. I think
          this line is such a perfect introduction for Puss learning who Death
          is. It incites fear really well, even for the audience. I think this
          is one of the lines that makes Death such a good villain.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"Wha-wha! What took you so long, IDIOT?" - Jack Horner</h2>
        <p>
          This is a line Jack Horner said in response to Jimminy Cricket saying
          "That was horrible! Your wish is horrible! You're horrible! You're an
          irredeemable monster!" I think this line does a great job of showing
          how genuinly evil Jack Horner is. He doesn't care about anything,
          including of what people think of him.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"And you're supposed to be dead!" - Goldilocks</h2>
        <p>
          This line is really only funny within the conext. Goldilocks and the
          three bears are hunting down Puss, and they find what they think is
          his grave. When they're at Jack Horner's, they see Puss alive and say
          this line. The Puss says the really funny line "I got better?" I think
          this is just a really funny and enjoyable scene because of this line.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>
          "Okay, okay, one more number. I call this one, "The Legend Will Never
          Di..." - Puss in Boots
        </h2>
        <p>
          This is when Puss just took out the monster of Delmar and everyone is
          cheering for him and asking for an encore. After he says this line,
          the bell that he used to take out the monster falls and kills Puss.
          This is really ironic because Puss was just saying that the legend,
          him, will never die.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>
          "You guys are jerks, which makes this very conflicting for me!" - Puss
          in Boots
        </h2>
        <p>
          This is from when Puss is talking to his past lives in the cave of
          lost souls. This shows some real character development for Puss
          because he realizes that he has been a jerk in his past lives. I think
          it is also really cool to see all of the past lives of Puss.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"Yeah, in the face, why?" - Jack Horner</h2>
        <p>
          Jack Horner says this after Jimminy Cricket says "You're not gonna
          shoot a puppy, are you, Jack?" This is another time where we see just
          how truly evil Jack is. He doesn't really care about anyone and he
          just wants to get the wish for himself, no matter the cost.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"Say hello to my gatito blade." - Puss in Boots</h2>
        <p>
          I think this is a really good moment that Puss has when he is fighting
          Death. It's kinda a shock to Death because he doesn't know that Puss
          has another weapon. It's also nice because that was a gift to him from
          Kitty Softpaws because he only has a wooden stick to use as a sword.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>
          "There's the famous hat, the feather and, of course, the boots." -
          Death
        </h2>
        <p>
          This is when Death is talking to Puss in the bar. This line highlights
          all of the iconic things from Puss. This scene is important because it
          is the first time Puss has been touched by a blade. This really
          incites fear into him and makes him realize that he is not invincible
          and he is on his last life.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"I just love the smell of fear" - Death</h2>
        <p>
          This is after Death cut Puss leaving some blood on his face for the
          first time. He then goes on to say "What's the matter? Lives flashing
          before your eyes?" And then he says "Pick it up. Pick... it... up."
          Finally, he says "Corre, corre, gatito," which in Spanish means "Run,
          run, little cat (Yeah, I take Spanish class)."
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"It's a stick sword!" - Perrito</h2>
        <p>
          This is when Perrito is bringing Puss a sword, but it's really just a
          stick. I think this is a good line at showing how upbeat and positive
          Perrito is, even when Puss was being negative. I also think that this
          is kinda a funny scene and that sword lasts a fair bit through the
          movie.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"Cause, I'm a real boy! No strings attached!" - Pinocchio</h2>
        <p>
          This is a flash back to when Jack Horner was a young boy: Little Jack
          Horner. I think this was a pretty cool scene and it provides an
          interesting story. We see how Pinocchio was bringing in the money fast
          because he's a magic puppet. But, when we get to the Shrek movie, he
          is being sold to Lord Farquaad for three shillings. Presumably, this
          means that he stopped bringing in money.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"Go ahead, run! Makes it more fun for me." - Death</h2>
        <p>
          This is another fear inciting line from Death. It really is part of
          what makes him such a good and scary villain in the Puss in Boots: The
          Last Wish movie. This shows how Death thinks of killing Puss to be
          more of a game than anything serious. He's not really worried because
          he knows he will win.
