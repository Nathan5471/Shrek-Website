      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"Ogres are like onions." - Shrek</h2>
        <p>
          I obviously have to start with probably the most quoted Shrek quote of
          all time, "Ogres are like onions." This was said by Shrek to Donkey
          when they were walking through the corn field. Shrek was trying to
          explain how ogres are more than just they appear, they are complex
          creatures with LAYERS!

      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"What are you doing in my SWAMP?" - Shrek</h2>
        <p>
          This is another very classic Shrek quote. Shrek yells this at all of
          the fairy tale creatures who have been dumped in HIS SWAMP by Lord
          Farquaad. I think this is just a fun line to say if you try to imitate
          Shrek.

      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"Do you know the muffin man?" - Gingy</h2>
        <p>
          I know I already covered this in Gingy sections of the character page,
          but I feel that this is just such a great scene it deserves to be
          mentioned again. This is an incredibly funny back and forth between
          Gingy and Lord Farquaad where they are talking about knowing the
          Muffin Man.
        </p>

      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"Better out than in, I always say!" - Shrek</h2>
        <p>
          This is just another classic and funny quote. But throughout the
          movie, it plays a much bigger role than just being funny. It shows
          that Fiona and Shrek are actually more alike than they think. This is
          used as a great way to progress their relationship. Not only does this
          play a role in Shrek and Fiona's relationship, it's also a part of the
          second movie. When Fiona and Shrek are having dinner with Harold and
          Lillian, Shrek says this line when Fiona burps. This really shows how
          different Shrek and Fiona are from Fiona's parents, and it reinforces
          Harold's initial beliefs and disliking of Shrek.

      <div class="quote">
        <h2>"And in the morning, I'm making waffles!" - Donkey</h2>
        <p>
          This is probably my favorite Donkey quotes. Donkey says this to Shrek
          when they first get to Shrek's swamp. This line is just so fun and I
          think it shows how fun Donkey is. This line is also refrenced in the
          forth movie when Donkey goes to try and eat some waffles that are
          actually a trap set by the rogue ogres.
