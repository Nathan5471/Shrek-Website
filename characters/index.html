            Shrek is the main character of the Shrek movies, oviously. He is a
            big, green, scary (not scary to me!) ogre who live in a SWAMP! Shrek
            shows a lot of character progression throughout the films, because
            at the start he was not willing to make friends, but in the end he
            became best friends with Donkey and Puss in Boots, and married
            Fiona.
