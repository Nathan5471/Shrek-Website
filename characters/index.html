          <h2>Shrek</h2>
          <p>
            Shrek is the main character of the Shrek movies, oviously. He is a
            big, green, scary (not scary to me!) ogre who live in a SWAMP! Shrek
            shows a lot of character progression throughout the films, because
            at the start he was not willing to make friends, but in the end he
            became best friends with Donkey and Puss in Boots, and married
            Fiona.

          <h2>Donkey</h2>
          <p>
            Donkey is Shrek's bestest friend ever! He started out as an annoying
            talking donkey (again, not annoying to me!) who really annoyed
            Shrek, but throughout the first move he became Shrek's friend. Later
            he also becomes best friends with Puss in Boots. Dokney even married
            the dragon from the first film and had 4 donkey-dragon hybrid babies
            with her.

          <h2>Fiona</h2>
          <p>
            Fiona is Shrek's wife and a princess from the kingdom of Far Far
            Away. She started out the first film as a human princess locked away
            in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon, that had an
            enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by
            true love's first kiss. She was rescued by Shrek and Donkey, but she
            thought Shrek was an ugly ogre (I think he's hot!) and thought that
            Farquaad was her true love. After spending a bunch of time with
            Shrek, she realized how hot, amazing, and funny Shrek is. Later she
            kissed Shrek and she was turned into an ogre permanently and then
            she got married to Shrek!

          <h2>Puss in Boots (aka Pickles)</h2>
          <p>
            Puss in Boots is our favorite fearless hero from the Shrek movies.
            He is even featured in his own spin-off movies! Puss in Boots was
            hired to kill Shrek by Fiona's father, King Harold, but he ended up
            become Shrek and Donkey's best friend because Shrek spared his life.
            He also has a really cool catchphrase: "Fear me, if you dare," where
            he also cuts his signature mark. In Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, he
            became friends with Perrito, and he picked up the nickname
            "Pickles." Puss is now down to only 1 of his 9 lives, so he has to
            live this one to the fullest.
