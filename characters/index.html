          <h2>Shrek</h2>
          <p>
            Shrek is the main character of the Shrek movies, oviously. He is a
            big, green, scary (not scary to me!) ogre who live in a SWAMP! Shrek
            shows a lot of character progression throughout the films, because
            at the start he was not willing to make friends, but in the end he
            became best friends with Donkey and Puss in Boots, and married
            Fiona.

          <h2>Donkey</h2>
          <p>
            Donkey is Shrek's bestest friend ever! He started out as an annoying
            talking donkey (again, not annoying to me!) who really annoyed
            Shrek, but throughout the first move he became Shrek's friend. Later
            he also becomes best friends with Puss in Boots. Dokney even married
            the dragon from the first film and had 4 donkey-dragon hybrid babies
            with her.

          <h2>Fiona</h2>
          <p>
            Fiona is Shrek's wife and a princess from the kingdom of Far Far
            Away. She started out the first film as a human princess locked away
            in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon, that had an
            enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by
            true love's first kiss. She was rescued by Shrek and Donkey, but she
            thought Shrek was an ugly ogre (I think he's hot!) and thought that
            Farquaad was her true love. After spending a bunch of time with
            Shrek, she realized how hot, amazing, and funny Shrek is. Later she
            kissed Shrek and she was turned into an ogre permanently and then
            she got married to Shrek!

          <h2>Puss in Boots (aka Pickles)</h2>
          <p>
            Puss in Boots is our favorite fearless hero from the Shrek movies.
            He is even featured in his own spin-off movies! Puss in Boots was
            hired to kill Shrek by Fiona's father, King Harold, but he ended up
            become Shrek and Donkey's best friend because Shrek spared his life.
            He also has a really cool catchphrase: "Fear me, if you dare," where
            he also cuts his signature mark. In Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, he
            became friends with Perrito, and he picked up the nickname
            "Pickles." Puss is now down to only 1 of his 9 lives, so he has to
            live this one to the fullest.

          <h2>Gingy</h2>
          <p>
            Do you know the Muffin Man? The Muffin Man? The Muffin Man. Yes I
            know the Muffin Man, who lives on Drury Lane? Well, she's married to
            the Muffin Man. The Muffin Man! The MUFFIN MAN!!! This is probably
            Gingy's most famous quote, along side "Not the gumdrop buttons!" He
            also had a big part in Shrek 2 in breaking into the castle while
            Fairy Godmother was doing an amazing performance of "Holding Out for
            a Hero." (More on that later!) He also has my favorite non Shrek
            movie canon: his girlfriend was eaten by Santa!

          <h2>Pinocchio</h2>
          <p>
            Pinocchio the puppet is a puppet made by Geppetto. Pinocchio always
            says he's a real boy, and for a short time in Shrek 2 he was. He is
            most known for his nose growing when he lies, and for wearing
            woman's underwear. I also wrote a play about Pinocchio for an
            English project, you should check it out

          <h2>Fairy Godmother</h2>
          <p>
            Fairy Godmother is the villain of Shrek 2, where she gives the
            worlds best performance of "Holding Out for a Hero." How do I even
            describe how amazing her performance is? It's just so perfect and
            amazing and perfect! Other than that, she is the Prince Charming's
            mom, and she wants him to marry Fiona.

          <h2>Perrito</h2>
          <p>
            While Perrito isn't in any of the Shrek movies, he is in one of the
            best movies ever: Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. Perrito is one of
            the reasons that movie so great, mostly because he is just so
            incredibly funny. My favorite Perrito moment is when he is talking
            about his past and talks about how when he was playing hide and
            seek, he was put in a sock with a rock. Other than that, he's just
            overall really fun and brings a lot of joy to the movie.

          <h2>Kitty Softpaws</h2>
          <p>
            Just like Perrito, Kitty Softpaws is only in the Puss in Boots
            movies, not the Shrek ones. I still think she is important and cool
            enough to get a mention. Kitty Softpaws gets her name because her
            previous owners got rid of her claws. Her main role is being Puss in
            Boot's love interest, but I think she brings a bit more to the
            story. My favorite part about Kitty is how untrusting she is and how
            that plays into the story. It leads to some really cool character
            development through the second movie as she starts to trust and love
            Puss again.
