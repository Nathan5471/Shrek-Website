    <h1>Shrek Music</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <p>
        One of the greatest parts of the Shrek movies is the music. On this
        page, I will break down some of the best songs from the Shrek movies.

          <h2>All Star - Smash Mouth</h2>
          <p>
            This song is the most iconic song from any of the Shrek films. Most
            of the song's popularity comes from the Shrek movies. It is in the
            opening scene of the movie, after Shrek tells us a fairytale. This
            is a great song to start the movie off with because it shows how
            confident Shrek is with himself. It's also just a very good song
            that I've memorized all of the lyrics to.

          <h2>I'm a Believer - Smash Mouth (& Donkey)</h2>
          <p>
            The next song I'm going to talk about is "I'm a Believer" at the end
            of the movie. I think this is a great song to end the movie off with
            because it shows how Shrek went from not believing in or caring
            about love or friendships, and now he loves Fiona and is best
            friends with Donkey. This is also the only chance Donkey gets to
            sing without being interrupted by Shrek.

          <h2>Hallelujah - Rufus Wainwright</h2>
          <p>
            Hallelujah is played during the scene where Fiona is leaving to go
            with Lord Farquaad. This song sets the mood for the scene really
            well, very sad. It greatly shows how Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey feel
            about being apart after being together for their trip. This sets up
            two relationships: Donkey & Dragon and Shrek & Fiona. Hallelujah is
            also just a very good song.

          <h2>Accidentally in Love - Counting Crows</h2>
          <p>
            Now it's time for the opening song from Shrek 2, "Accidentally in
            Love." This song is played during Shrek and Fiona's honeymoon. This
            song is actually a great representation of how Shrek and Fiona fell
            in love, because they weren't really intending to fall in love, it
            just kinda happened. We also get another great Shrek mud hot tub
            scene! Again, this song is really good and very catchy.

          <h2>Holding Out for a Hero - Fairy Godmother</h2>
          <p>
            Okay, I can't resist any logger, time to talk about "Holding Out for
            a Hero!" This is such an amazing performance by the Fairy Godmother.
            This is the scene where Shrek is trying to be the hero and save
            Fiona from being with Prince Charming, who she doesn't want to be
            with. We also get to see a Giant Gingy! This song is probably my
            favorite song from the movies.
