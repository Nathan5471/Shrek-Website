    <h1>Shrek Music</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <p>
        One of the greatest parts of the Shrek movies is the music. On this
        page, I will break down some of the best songs from the Shrek movies.

          <h2>All Star - Smash Mouth</h2>
          <p>
            This song is the most iconic song from any of the Shrek films. Most
            of the song's popularity comes from the Shrek movies. It is in the
            opening scene of the movie, after Shrek tells us a fairytale. This
            is a great song to start the movie off with because it shows how
            confident Shrek is with himself. It's also just a very good song
            that I've memorized all of the lyrics to.

          <h2>I'm a Believer - Smash Mouth (& Donkey)</h2>
          <p>
            The next song I'm going to talk about is "I'm a Believer" at the end
            of the movie. I think this is a great song to end the movie off with
            because it shows how Shrek went from not believing in or caring
            about love or friendships, and now he loves Fiona and is best
            friends with Donkey. This is also the only chance Donkey gets to
            sing without being interrupted by Shrek.

          <h2>Hallelujah - Rufus Wainwright</h2>
          <p>
            Hallelujah is played during the scene where Fiona is leaving to go
            with Lord Farquaad. This song sets the mood for the scene really
            well, very sad. It greatly shows how Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey feel
            about being apart after being together for their trip. This sets up
            two relationships: Donkey & Dragon and Shrek & Fiona. Hallelujah is
            also just a very good song.

          <h2>Accidentally in Love - Counting Crows</h2>
          <p>
            Now it's time for the opening song from Shrek 2, "Accidentally in
            Love." This song is played during Shrek and Fiona's honeymoon. This
            song is actually a great representation of how Shrek and Fiona fell
            in love, because they weren't really intending to fall in love, it
            just kinda happened. We also get another great Shrek mud hot tub
            scene! Again, this song is really good and very catchy.

          <h2>Holding Out for a Hero - Fairy Godmother</h2>
          <p>
            Okay, I can't resist any logger, time to talk about "Holding Out for
            a Hero!" This is such an amazing performance by the Fairy Godmother.
            This is the scene where Shrek is trying to be the hero and save
            Fiona from being with Prince Charming, who she doesn't want to be
            with. We also get to see a Giant Gingy! This song is probably my
            favorite song from the movies.

          <h2>Royal Pain - Eels</h2>
          <p>
            I wasn't really sure if I was going to talk about Shrek the Third
            because there aren't really any songs that really stood out to me.
            I'm gonna talk to this one because it kinda just feels like they
            were taking the easy way out. It starts out with "I got some sleep
            and I needed it." This feels cheap because in Shrek 2 they were
            playing "I need some sleep" by Lux. I assume they pick this song
            because what Shrek is going through is a royal (literally) pain.

          <h2>Shake Your Groove Thing - Peaches & Herb</h2>
          <p>
            I don't really think this song is that exceptional, I just want to
            talk about the villian and the dance scene. The Piper is one of the
            villains of Shrek Forever After, and he is able to control people by
            playing music. I think this is a really unique and fun idea for a
            villain. We also get to see some awesome ogre dancing from Shrek,
            and all of the other ogres.

          <h2>Who I'd Be - Shrek the Musical</h2>
          <p>
            I know this isn't a Shrek movie, but I really like the songs from
            Shrek the Musical (try and stop me). This is probably my favorite
            song from the entire musical. I'm not really sure why this is my
            favorite, but I do have some theories: Brian d'Arcy James is an
            INCREDIBLE singer, or it could be that I'm a really big fan of Shrek
            himself. Perhaps it's event a combination of both.

          <h2>Don't Let Me Go - Shrek the Musical</h2>
          <p>
            This is another favorite of my from the musical, I just really enjoy
            the way Donkey sings. There are also some really funny jokes. One of
            which is the line "I'm gonna be on you like a fat kid on cake!"
            Another one is "You don't know what it's like to be considered a
            freak! Well maybe you do." I think this is a great song to have
            Donkey sing because it shows how funny he is in the Shrek movie and

          <h2>I Think I Got You Beat - Shrek the Musical</h2>
          <p>
            This is another great song. I really enjoy the back and forth that
            Shrek and Fiona have. It's also interesting to learn about about the
            struggles that Fiona and Shrek have gone through in their lifes.
            This wasn't covered in the movies, but I think it's really cool to
            learn about what they went through. Now, I can't talk about this
            song and not talk about the ending. At the end of the song, Shrek
            and Fiona are trying to out gross each other with farts and burps.
            And then Donkey walks up and smells all of it.

          <h2>The Ballad of Farquaad - Shrek the Musical</h2>
          <p>
            Oh man, why are there so many songs from the musical that I want to
            talk about? I'll keep it SHORT for this one (get it?). This song is
            cool because we get to learn more about Lord Farquaad and how his
            dad is also short. We also learn that his Dad was grumpy and that he
            slept seven to a bed. So, this means that Lord Farquaad's Dad is
            probably Grumpy from "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." (I'm not
            sure if this is lore, but it's a theory of mine).

          <h2>When Words Fail - Shrek the Musical</h2>
          <p>
            Another song from the musical, who is picking these? Oh wait, that's
            me. This is a song about how Shrek wants to tell Fiona how he feels,
            but he's woried that words won't be enough and that they will fail
            him. It goes through different ways Shrek thinks he should tell
            Fiona that he loves her. This is another song that is one of my
            favorites from the musical, probably my second favorite.

          <h2>Big Bright Beautiful World - Shrek the Musical</h2>
          <p>
            This is the opening song from the musical. It starts out with Shrek
            sing about how great his life is in the swamp. Then, his parents
            send him away. I really enjoy the subversion that his parents do by
            saying great things about the world, but then saying "but not for
            you." I just think this is really funny. Then it goes into Shrek
            accepting that he's an ogre and life is going to be more difficult.
            He becomes happy with who he is.

            This is the song Puss played at the start of Puss in Boots: The Last

            best. But, the song is really good and probably one of my favorite
