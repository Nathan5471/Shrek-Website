    <h1>Shrek Music</h1>

      <p>
        One of the greatest parts of the Shrek movies is the music. On this
        page, I will break down some of the best songs from the Shrek movies.

          <h2>All Star - Smash Mouth</h2>
          <p>
            This song is the most iconic song from any of the Shrek films. Most
            of the song's popularity comes from the Shrek movies. It is in the
            opening scene of the movie, after Shrek tells us a fairytale. This
            is a great song to start the movie off with because it shows how
            confident Shrek is with himself. It's also just a very good song
            that I've memorized all of the lyrics to.

          <h2>I'm a Believer - Smash Mouth (& Donkey)</h2>
          <p>
            The next song I'm going to talk about is "I'm a Believer" at the end
            of the movie. I think this is a great song to end the movie off with
            because it shows how Shrek went from not believing in or caring
            about love or friendships, and now he loves Fiona and is best
            friends with Donkey. This is also the only chance Donkey gets to
            sing without being interrupted by Shrek.
